        "In this assignment, you will:\n",
        "- Load the Airbnb dataset you cleaned in Assignment 6\n",
        "- Apply data transformation techniques like scaling, binning, encoding, and feature creation\n",
        "- Make the dataset easier to use for tasks like pricing analysis, guest segmentation, or listing recommendations\n",
        "- Practice writing up your analysis clearly so a business audience — like a host, marketing manager, or city partner — could understand it\n",

        "## Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Airbnb analysts, hosts, and city partners rely on clean and well-structured data to make smart decisions. Whether they’re adjusting prices, identifying high-performing listings, or designing better guest experiences, they need data that’s transformed, organized, and ready for use.\n",
