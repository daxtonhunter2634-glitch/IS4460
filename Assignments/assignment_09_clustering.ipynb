        "- Apply unsupervised learning to explore patterns in hotel booking behavior\n",
        "- Use K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for customer segmentation\n",
        "- Evaluate model quality with metrics like Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index\n",

        "Businesses like hotels and travel platforms (e.g., Airbnb or Expedia) rely on customer segmentation to tailor promotions, pricing strategies, and service levels. Unlike supervised models, clustering helps uncover patterns when no labels exist‚Äîan ideal tool when entering new markets or analyzing unstructured customer behavior.\n",
